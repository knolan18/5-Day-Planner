## 5-Day-Planner

For this assignment, a dynamic day planner was created. The user can enter things that they need to do at a certain time in that hour's textarea, and the text will be saved to local storage, so that when the page is refresh, the user's information will still be displayed. As the day progresses, the hours that have passed turn grey, and the hours in the future are green. The current hour is red.
